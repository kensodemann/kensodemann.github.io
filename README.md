A personal blog where I write about things that are of some sort of interest to me.

## Editing

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Look there if you have questions.

To test out changes locally without publishing: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Or, if you need more information, check [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

That should pretty much be it. Good luck!
