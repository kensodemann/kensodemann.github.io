These links are associated with my public [Deeplinks Demo][PublicDeeplinksDemo] application. This application does not fully work on iOS at this time. I could rectify that, but it is not really all that high on my list of things to do at this time.

- [Current Weather][rootTest]
- [Forecasts][categoriesTest]
- [UV Index][ratingsTest]
- [Current Weather Using URI][rootTestURI]
- [Forecasts Using URI][categoriesTestURI]
- [UV Index Using URI][ratingsTestURI]


These links are associated with the private Ionic Customer Success demo applications (the code and app are private, not the web-site...)

- [Green Tea][greenTest]
- [White Tea][whiteTest]
- [Yellow Tea][yellowTest]
