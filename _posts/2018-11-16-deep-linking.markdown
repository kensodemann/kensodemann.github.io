These links are associated with my public (and very out of date) [Deeplinks Demo][PublicDeeplinksDemo] application. This application does not fully work on iOS at this time. I could rectify that, but it is not really all that high on my list of things to do at this time.

- [Forecasts][categoriesTest]
- [UV Index][ratingsTest]
- [Current Weather Using URI][rootTestURI]
- [Forecasts Using URI][categoriesTestURI]
